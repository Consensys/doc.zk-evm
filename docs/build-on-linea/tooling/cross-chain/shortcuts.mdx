A Shortcut allows users to execute onchain actions by sending funds to a contract address.

Each Shortcut is a unique smart contract designed to carry out the desired function. Shortcuts are
represented by ENS domains, making addresses human-readable.

:::note

Shortcuts currently only supports Ethereum Mainnet as the source chain, unless explicitly specified 
by the Shortcut description. Shortcut addresses are not chain-agnostic, but are different from 
network to network. Sending ETH (or other tokens) to the wrong network may result in a loss of funds.

## How it works (user flow)

A simple use case for a Shortcut could involve a user who wants to streamline the process of 
bridging ETH to Linea:

1. A user sends ETH to a Shortcut address 
2. The ETH is automatically bridged to Linea via [Across](https://across.to/)
3. The ETH is returned as native Linea ETH to the sender on the destination chain (Linea).

More complex Shortcuts can do additional things: bridge and swap, bridge and deposit to a liquidity 
pool, bridge and stake/restake. The developer's imagination is the only limit.

## How it works (technical)

Shortcuts trigger actions using a fallback function in the smart contract called `receive()`. This 
allows users to initiate a transaction without approvals. The contract engages with Across 
intent-based listeners and paths that will execute the action on the destination chain. 

The output token(s) from the automation are returned to `msg.sender` (the account that called the 
function; in this case, the person using the Shortcut).

## Fees

Shortcuts are provided by [onthis.xyz](https://www.onthis.xyz/) and are built on top of [Across](https://across.to/). 
Both services charge users a fee on the origin network. This fee covers the bridging costs and 
automation costs and is shared between the two providers. The fee is calculated as a percentage 
of the amount transferred, and is on top of the network gas fee paid to execute the action on the 
origin chain.

Here is an example of the Shortcuts fee model:

| Amount ($)    | Swap + bridge fees |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
|      100      |     5.4% ($5.40)   |
|      500      |     0.5% ($0.50)   |
|    1,000      |     0.5% ($5.00)   |
|   10,000      |     0.5% ($50.00)  |
|  100,000      |     0.5% ($500.00) |

## Risks

Shortcuts do not store value, so the smart contract risk is lower than a traditional dapps. Since 
they are built on Across, they share its risk profile.

There are several other risks inherent in Shortcuts: 

### Chain-dependent addressing

Every Shortcut has a different contract address. Even the same Shortcut deployed on two different 
networks (Ethereum Mainnet and Arbitrum, for example) will have a different address. Moreover, 
Shortcuts only work with ETH. Sending tokens (ERC-20, ERC-721, or others) to a Shortcut may result 
in a loss of funds, as will sending ETH to a Shortcut deployed on a different network.

Linea addresses this risk by clearly identifying the Shortcut's network in its name. If a network 
is specified, it means that the Shortcut can only accept ETH on that specific network. The naming 
convention for Shortcut ENS names curated by Linea is as follows:

`[network].[usecase/partner].onlinea.eth`

In practice, this could look something like:

`arbitrum.bridge.onlinea.eth`

The omission of the `[network]` prefix indicates that the Shortcut relates to Ethereum Mainnet; 
`bridge.onlinea.eth`, for example, only works on Ethereum Mainnet.

### Naming system

The easy UX of sending ETH to an ENS name can present a risk for the user. An attacker can obtain 
access to the owner key of the ENS name and change the address record, pointing it to their own 
wallet and collecting the funds sent there. 

Linea addresses this risk by controlling the ENS name with a multisig wallet and assigning the 
manager role to the Linea Security Council (the maximum grade of security). We also have monitors
in place that listen for role changes for the ENS name.

### Upgradability of contracts 

Shortcuts can be upgraded by the creator. An attacker can upgrade the contract and change its 
behavior. Linea addresses this risk by requiring trusted creators (like the [onthis.xyz](https://www.onthis.xyz/) team) 
to hold the owner keys in a secure multisig or asking the creators to hand over the ownership of 
the contracts to the Linea multisig.

### Contract security 

Even though Shortcuts contracts do not store value, security audits are still important. Shortcuts 
created via the [Creator Tool](https://create.onthis.xyz/) have a deterministic output that is
included in the audit scope of the Creator Tool itself. Custom built shortcuts require an 
independent audit. 

Linea addresses this risk by including a third-party audit of the Shortcuts listed under 
onlinea.eth as part of the curation process.
