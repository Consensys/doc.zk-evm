To get started with Goldsky Index:

1. Create an account at **[app.goldsky.com](https://app.goldsky.com/)**.
2. Choose a plan that best fits your needs.
3. Create an API key on the **[Settings page](https://app.goldsky.com/dashboard/settings)**.
4. Install the Goldsky CLI:
    
    ```bash
    npm install -g @goldskycom/cli
    ```
    
5. Log in with the API key created earlier:
    
    ```bash
    goldsky login
    ```
    
6. Deploy your subgraph
    
    ```bash
    cd <your-subgraph-directory>
    graph build # Build your subgraph as normal.
    goldsky subgraph deploy my-subgraph/1.0.0
    ```
    
7. Alternative, subgraphs can be deployed using Goldsky’s instant subgraph functionality
    
    ```bash
    goldsky subgraph deploy <subgraphName>/<subgraphVersion> --from-abi <path-to-config-file>
    ```
    
    Config files for instant subgraphs are written in JSON and outline key information such as the chain, contract address, and path to ABI file. An example of a basic configuration file is below.
    
    ```bash
    {
      "version": "1",
      "name": "TokenDeployed",
      "abis": {
        "TokenRegistry": {
          "path": "./abis/token-registry.json"
        }
      },
      "chains": ["mainnet"],
      "instances": [
        {
          "abi": "TokenRegistry",
          "address": "0x0A6f564C5c9BeBD66F1595f1B51D1F3de6Ef3b79",
          "startBlock": 13983724,
          "chain": "mainnet"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    
8. Once deployed, you can access data using the GraphQL API link provided, and review all deployed subgraphs with `goldsky subgraph list` or at app.goldsky.com.
