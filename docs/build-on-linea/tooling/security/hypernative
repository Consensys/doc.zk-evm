[Hypernative](https://hypernative.io/) stops zero day cyber attacks, economic risks, detects on-chain anomalies and protects digital assets, protocols and Web3 applications from significant losses or threats.

Powered by our “pre-cog” platform, Hypernative monitors on and off chain data sources using our proprietary machine learning models to accurately predict cyber,
economic and governance threats before they manifest. The detections are then connected to various automated playbooks to prevent and mitigate risks in real time.
