Viem is TypeScript Interface for Ethereum, enabling you to build reliable apps and libraries with lightweight, composable, and type-safe modules that interface with Ethereum.

As the authors of wagmi, a popular React Hooks library for Ethereum, we struggled to work with the existing low-level TypeScript Ethereum libraries. We wanted to provide the users of wagmi with the best possible developer experience.

**Viem**: a TypeScript Interface for Ethereum that provides low-level stateless primitives for interacting with Ethereum. An alternative to ethers.js and web3.js with a focus on reliability, efficiency, and excellent developer experience.

To point to your dapp on Linea, you need to use ```import { linea, lineaSepolia } from 'viem/chains'``` 'lineaSepolia', and `linea` for Linea Mainnet.
